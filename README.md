Map Rules:  
It has to be a **rectangular closed map** (walls around) and there needs to be a valid way to collect the diamonds and to the exit.
It has to have at least one collectible.
The map file extension has to be **'.ber'**.  
The map is composed by 5 elements:  
```
- '1' for walls;
- '0' for available floor;
- 'P' for Player starting position;
- 'E' for exit;
- 'C' for collectible;
```

Map example:
```
11111111111111111
10P001C0001C000C1
11110111101110111
10000000000000001
111101110111C1101

To run the program, you need to select a map from the existing ones or the one that you've created. For that, you need to put its filename. The map needs to be inside the **maps** folder  
  
```bash
$> ./so_long map_1.ber
```

To exit the game, just press 'ESC' on your keyboard or click the 'X' in the game window. **HAVE FUN!**
